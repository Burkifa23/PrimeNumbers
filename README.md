### Task 1: Create a Function to check if a number is Prime

In mathematics, extensive research focuses on unique numbers
known as primes. A prime number is a natural number greater
than 1 that possesses a special property: it can only be divided
evenly by 1 and itself. In simpler terms, it cannot be represented
as the product of two or more smaller numbers, excluding 1.

So, for example, 5 is a prime number because it's only divisible by
1 and 5. You cannot express it-in terms of natural numbers-as a
product of 2 and any other value.

On the other hand, 6 is not a prime number since it's divisible by 2
and 3. It can be written as 2x3. And 12 is not a prime because it's
divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.

The first five prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11-meaning
that 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 are not prime. As a special case, 1 is not
considered a prime.

Your first task is to create a Python function,
determines whether a given number
should return either is_prime(n) n 
that is prime. This function True  or False

### Task 2: Count Prime Number in a range

After creating a function to check if a number is prime, consider
the range of natural numbers from 100 to 151 inclusive. Find how
many prime numbers are present in this range.


### Task 3: Optimize the function

Consider your code for the function is_prime(n). Can you
improve it by making fewer iterations? This is more of a logical
consideration regarding prime numbers rather than a purely
coding solution (and it will depend on how you decided to
implement the function).
